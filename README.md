# chavolix-js
A core animation framework in JavaScript - focused on animating data values - not HTML elements.

By core animation is meant controlling of frames and frame rates and notifying animation
objects about the current time etc. 

What an animation object decides to do is up each animation object. It can render graphics on an 
HTML5 canvas, animate DOM or SVG elements, or do something else entirely.
